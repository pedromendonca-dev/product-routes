In this project, I've delved into areas I hadn't previously explored with such depth and complexity, like routes passing IDs and utilizing URL parameters. Additionally, I've used a JSON server to pass parameters without needing to declare them in memory. In a previous project, I had the opportunity to interact more extensively with a JSON server, adding and deleting products directly from it. There's a lot of potential for creativity with these tools, including the possibility of adding a product addition page to dynamically update the database.</p>
